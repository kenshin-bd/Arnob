        <p>Shayan Chowdhury (known as Arnob) is a Bangladeshi singer-songwriter, musician, and artist who has been a major figure in the popular culture of Bangladesh. Most of his famous work comes from his early albums, when songs such as "She Je Boshe Ache" (2005) and "Tomar Jonno" (2006) became popular in the whole country.[1]

            Arnob attended Willes Little Flower School, and for better art education was sent to Santiniketan, where he met his future wife Sahana Bajpaie. He attended Visva-Bharati University, where he formed the folk band Bangla in 1998. After leaving the band, he came back from Kolkata and started working on his solo albums. In 2005, he got his breakthrough with his debut album, Chaina Bhabish, which featured some of the best songs composed by him: "Hariye Giyechi" and "She Je Boshe Ache", the Daily Star commented: "She Je Boshe Ache is undoubtedly the catchiest track of all. The tune itself, in the simplest of words, is beautiful!". His second album was Hok Kolorob. By 2008, he explored rock music, as that time many alternative rock bands earned huge popularity. His third album, Doob featured many electrically amplified rock songs like: "Shopno Debe Doob", "Adhkana", "Akash Kalo" and "Rastai".
